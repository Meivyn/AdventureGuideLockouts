# Encounter Journal Saved Instances
A fork and continuation of [Adventure Guide Saved Instances](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/adventure-guide-saved-instances) WoW AddOn.

Tracks instance lockouts with your Encounter Journal, including World Bosses and LFR. A flag will be displayed on the instance's button for each difficulty with details on available and killed bosses.

To help me with debugging, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meivyn/EncounterJournalSavedInstances/issues) when something don't work as expected, so I could fix it as soon as I can. Your help is really appreciated.
